<h1>Release 2 Impact</h1>

<div id="overview" >
    <p>For release two, our goals as a team focused on enhancing level systems, creating more engaging interactions,
        and providing more feedback to the player. With another engineer working on feedback,
        I focused heavily on level systems and interactions. Our first priorities for level interactions were basic
        moving platforms and doors/barriers. Although I knew these would be somewhat basic systems, I used this as an
        opportunity to grow my skills. To do this, I built these simple systems into robust, customizable tools that
        allow our designers to easily implement unique features.

    <h3>Moving Platforms</h3>
    <p>
        Moving platforms are easily one of the most simple features to program from a base perspective but my goal with
        this system was to build a much more feature rich tool than one might expect from a simple moving platform.
        This was accomplished primarily through the use of custom inspector scripts which I go over
        <a href="#editors">here</a>.
        <br><br>
        Given the scope of features I wanted to provide, it was important that the system remained bug free and
        performant.
        <br><br>
        Of course, no task is simple when working in a large project. Challenges arose while building these features
        and had to be dealt with accordingly.

    <h4>Translation Options</h4>
    <p>
        The primary feature I built into this system is the option to use differing translation types. I started with
        default linear pathing between nodes but knew it had to be expanded further. In addition to standard linear,
        the system offers options for damp motion, translation via a steering algorithm, or translation via linear
        interpolation along an animation curve set in the inspector. Setting up the system in such a way that all of
        these movement options were valid was one of the more demanding tasks for this work.

    <h4>Adjusting Player Motion</h4>
    <p>
        Most platform systems I have previously designed handle application of platform motion to the player by setting
        the platform object as a parent of the player object. In many cases, this is an easy and effective way of
        translating the player in conjunction with the platform. For this project, we designed the character controls
        using the unity character controller. Due to the interactions behind the scenes there, I was unable to achieve
        the desired behavior via a parent/child relationship. To overcome this I modified the player to accept an
        additional vector while calculating motion, this vector is then supplied by any platform that they have made
        contact with.

    <h3>Custom Barriers</h3>
    <p>
        Similar to my approach with moving platforms. I wanted the barrier system to be equally robust and feature rich.
        Much of this took the form of custom inspector scripts, but I also implemented a few features to simplify the
        system for both myself and designers.

    <h4>Event Handling</h4>
    <p>
        I knew immediately while brainstorming on this that I would be using events to handle communication between the
        parent object and individual barrier segments. My primary reasoning for this was a desire to avoid storing
        arrays of barrier segments for each parent GameObject. The use of events makes the system more performant while also
        providing easy communication between scripts.

        </p>

    <h4>Linq Lambda Boolean</h4>
    <p>
        Another small but interesting feature was my use of a lambda expression for one of the key boolean variables
        utilized. Barriers have the potential to be locked with any number of keys, keys can be stored in a key manager
        inventory, but I needed a quick way to check if a specific door should be unlocked.

    <h2 style="background-color:#C6C6C6">Custom Editors</h2>
    <p>
        One of my biggest learning moments while working towards this release was my discovery of custom editor
        scripts. I had never used them before, but I found them easy to use while providing huge benefits to the
        customization and usability of these systems.
    </p>
    <h4>Object Instantiation</h4>
    <p>
        The most prominent feature I included via custom editor code was the ability to add and remove system objects
        from the inspector. This added multiple benefits, firstly, no more hunting for the correct prefab when adding
        segments, nodes, and keys. On top of this, using the inspector callouts to delete objects ensured that they do
        not persist as null entries in any collections used.

    <h4>Dynamic Inspector Display</h4>
    <p>
        Another helpful feature I was able to achieve via custom editor code was a dynamic display for the platform
        inspector. Given the many translation options mentioned earlier, I wanted a way for designers to easily
        differentiate between options that only affect certain movement types. This also allowed me to keep the inspector
        from becoming bloated with information. I accomplished this via a switch statement that only rendered
        properties needed for the selected translation state.
